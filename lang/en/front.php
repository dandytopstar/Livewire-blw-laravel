Baby-led weaning offers parents a way to bypass the idea of baby food entirely. Growing in popularity, baby-led weaning is particularly popular with parents who want to avoid raising picky eaters, as well as parents who subscribe to Montessori-type philosophies of child-rearing where children are encouraged to be self-sufficient.',

        <p>Baby-Led weaning is very safe for your baby, as long as you provide safe foods and abide by basic safety feeding guidelines, some of which are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Feed meals and snacks to babies only while they are sitting upright. Avoid letting them crawl, walk or play around while eating.</li>
            <li>
                Do not leave your baby unattended to during meals.
            </li>
            <li>
                Avoid serving foods that are choking hazards. These include popcorn, whole nuts, uncooked apple slices, uncooked dried fruits, fish that contains bones, crunchy snacks, etc. Some others, such as grapes or cherries, may be cut into smaller pieces that are safer for the child to chew.
            </li>
            <li>
                Educate everyone who takes care of your child on baby-led weaning. It is essential that the caregivers also maintain the same safety precautions as you do.
            </li>
            <li>
                Observe for any allergic reactions in your babies. These may include sneezing, wheezing, stomach pain with or without diarrhea, vomiting, and swellings. It is advised that you consult your pediatrician to be sure of when to introduce allergens such as eggs, peanuts, and even seafood into your baby’s meals.
