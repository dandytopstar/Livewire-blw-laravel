Therefore, our coaches and nutritionists are working incessantly to offer you a suitable meal plan and personalized routine for your babies while helping them gain confidence at an early age and reach their potential through extensive practice that includes but isn’t limited to dexterity, hand-eye coordination, etc. This is not far-fetched as this process is done at the babies’ pace, whereby they are in control of what they eat and the quantity of the new meal(s) being incorporated into their diet.",
