            registration information and the User Content and use such information and the User<br />
            Content as reasonably necessary for or incidental to its operation of the Service and as<br />

            3.6. You agree, and represent and warrant, that your use of the Service, or any portion<br />

            3.8. We retain the right to implement any changes to the Service (whether to free or paid<br />
            features) at any time, with or without notice. You acknowledge that a variety of Company&#39;s<br />
            actions may impair or prevent you from accessing the Service at certain times and/or in the<br />
            same way, for limited periods or permanently, and agree that the Company has no<br />
            responsibility or liability as a result of any such actions or results, including, without<br />
            limitation, for the deletion of, or failure to make available to you, any content or services.<br />
            3.9. The Company has no obligation to provide you with customer support of any kind.<br />
            However, the Company may provide you with customer support from time to time, at the<br />

            4. THIRD PARTY ADS, OTHER USERS<br />
            4.1. The Service may contain links to third party websites or resources and advertisements<br />
            for third parties (collectively, &quot;Third Party Ads&quot;). Such Third Party Ads are not under the<br />
            control of the Company and the Company is not responsible for any Third Party Ads. The<br />
            Company provides these Third Party Ads only as a convenience and does not review,<br />
            approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to Third Party<br />
            Ads. Advertisements and other information provided by Third Party Sites Ads may not be<br />
            wholly accurate. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from<br />
            your use of any such websites or resources. When you link to a third party site, the<br />
            applicable service provider&#39;s terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering<br />
            practices govern. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or<br />
            appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any third party. Your transactions<br />
            and other dealings with Third Party Ads that are found on or through the website, including<br />
            payment and delivery of related goods or services, are solely between you and such<br />
            merchant or advertiser.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>4.2. Each user of the Service is solely responsible for any and all his or her User Content.<br />
            Because we do not control the User Content, you acknowledge and agree that we are not<br />
            responsible for any User Content and we make no guarantees regarding the accuracy,<br />
            currency, suitability, or quality of any User Content, and we assume no responsibility for any<br />
            User Content. Your interactions with other Service users are solely between you and such<br />
            user. You agree that the Company will not be responsible for any loss or damage incurred<br />
            as the result of any such interactions. If there is a dispute between you and any Service<br />
            user, we are under no obligation to become involved.<br />
            5. SUBSCRIPTION FEES AND PAYMENT<br />
            5.1. Certain features of the Service may be offered on a subscription basis for a fee. You<br />
            may purchase a subscription directly from the Company paying a subscription fee in<br />
            advance on a recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase; or (2) pre-payment<br />
            giving you access to the Service for a specific time period (together or separately<br />
            &ldquo;Purchase&rdquo;).<br />
            5.2. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, we may change Purchase fees at<br />
            any time. We will give you reasonable notice of any such pricing changes by posting the<br />
            new prices on the website and/or by sending you an e-mail notification, or in other<br />
            prominent way. If you do not wish to pay the new fees, you can cancel the applicable<br />
            subscription prior to the change going into effect or/and abstain from pre-paying for access<br />
            to the Service.<br />
            5.3. You authorize us to charge the applicable fees to the payment card that you submit.<br />
            5.4. By signing up for certain subscriptions, you agree that your subscription may be<br />
            automatically renewed. Unless you cancel your subscription you authorize us to charge you<br />
            for the renewal term. The period of auto-renewal will be the same as your initial subscription<br />
            period unless otherwise disclosed to you on the Service. The renewal rate will be no more<br />
            than the rate for the immediately prior subscription period, excluding any promotional and</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>discount pricing, unless we notify you of a rate change prior to your auto-renewal. You must<br />
            cancel your subscription in accordance with the cancellation procedures disclosed to you for<br />
            the particular subscription. We will not refund fees that may have accrued to your account<br />
            and will not prorate fees for a cancelled subscription.<br />
            5.5. We may offer a trial subscription for the Service. Trial provides you access to the<br />
            Service for a period of time, with details specified when you sign up for the offer. Unless you<br />
            cancel before the end of the free trial, or unless otherwise stated, your access to the Service<br />
            will automatically continue and you will be billed the applicable fees for the Service. It is<br />
            ultimately your responsibility to know when the free trial will end. We reserve the right, in our<br />
            absolute discretion, to modify or terminate any free trial offer, your access to the Service<br />
            during the free trial, or any of these terms without notice and with no liability. We reserve the<br />
            right to limit your ability to take advantage of multiple free trials.<br />
            5.6. The Service and your rights to use it expire at the end of the paid period of your<br />
            subscription. If you do not pay the fees or charges due, we may make reasonable efforts to<br />
            notify you and resolve the issue; however, we reserve the right to disable or terminate your<br />
            access to the Service (and may do so without notice).<br />
            5.7. You agree that the Purchase is final, that Company will not refund any transaction once<br />
            it has been made and that the Purchase cannot be canceled. When you make the<br />
            Purchase, you acknowledge and agree that all Purchases are non-refundable or<br />
            exchangeable. Since the Service is of a digital nature, we cannot accept any request for<br />
            refunds and therefore your right of withdrawal is lost at this point. The Company may<br />
            provide refunds at its own discretion and subject to our policies that may be published from<br />
            time to time.<br />
            5.8. We may post clear and conspicuous subscription terms from time to time on our<br />
            website.</p>

            We may at any time modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any<br />
            part thereof) at our sole discretion with or without notice. You agree that we shall not be<br />
            liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the<br />
            Service.<br />
            8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY<br />
            8.1. IN NO EVENT SHALL WE (AND OUR AFFILIATES) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY<br />
            THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFIT OR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,<br />
            EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM THESE<br />
            TERMS OR YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICE (INCLUDING THE<br />
            CONTENT), OR THIRD PARTY ADS, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br />
            POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ACCESS TO, AND USE OF, THE SERVICE<br />
            (INCLUDING THE CONTENT AND USER CONTENT), AND THIRD PARTY ADS ARE AT<br />
            YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR<br />
            ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTING SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA RESULTING<br />
            THEREFROM.<br />
            8.2. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, YOU<br />
            AGREE THAT THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO YOU FOR ANY AND<br />
            ALL CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE WEBSITE, CONTENT OR SERVICE IS</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>LIMITED TO THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO THE COMPANY FOR ACCESS TO<br />
            AND USE OF THE SERVICE. THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE<br />
            ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE TERMS BETWEEN THE<br />
            COMPANY AND YOU.<br />
            8.3. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF<br />
            LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE<br />
            LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE<br />
            OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.<br />
            9. INDEMNITY<br />
            You agree to indemnify and hold the Company, its successors, subsidiaries, affiliates, any<br />
            related companies, its suppliers, licensors and partners, and the officers, directors,<br />
            employees, agents and representatives of each of them harmless, including costs and<br />
            attorneys&#39; fees, from any claim or demand made by any third party due to or arising out of (i)<br />
            your use of the Service, (ii) your User Content, or (ii) your violation of these Terms.<br />
            The Company reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and<br />
            control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us and you agree to cooperate<br />
            with our defense of these claims. You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written<br />
            consent of the Company. The Company will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such<br />
            claim, action or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.<br />
            10. INTERNATIONAL USE<br />

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>11. MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION<br />
            WAIVER<br />
            Please read this arbitration provision carefully to understand your rights.<br />
            (a) All claims must be resolved through binding arbitration by a neutral arbitrator;<br />
            (b) You are waiving the right to a trial by jury; the rights that you would have if you went to<br />
            court, such as discovery or the right to appeal, may be more limited or may not exist;<br />
            (c) You may only bring a claim in your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff (lead or<br />
            otherwise) or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding;<br />
            (d) The arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or claims or otherwise preside over any<br />
            form of a representative or class proceeding.<br />
            a. Mandatory Arbitration<br />
            This arbitration agreement provides that all disputes must be resolved through BINDING<br />
            ARBITRATION whenever you or we choose to submit or refer a dispute to arbitration. You<br />
            and the Company, and each of our respective agents, corporate parents, subsidiaries,<br />
            affiliates, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, agree to BINDING<br />
            ARBITRATION (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court), as the<br />
            exclusive form of dispute resolution except as provided for below, for all disputes and claims<br />
            arising out of or relating to these Terms (including the Privacy Policy) or the Service, unless<br />
            you are located in a jurisdiction that prohibits the exclusive use of arbitration for dispute<br />
            resolution. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE Terms, you and we are each<br />
            waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.<br />
            b. Waiver of Class Action and Collective Relief</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>There shall be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated or litigated on a class<br />
            action, joint or consolidated basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported<br />
            representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other users of the Services, or any<br />
            other persons. The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking<br />
            relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that individual party&rsquo;s<br />
            claim. The arbitrator may not award relief for or against anyone who is not a party. The<br />
            arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&rsquo;s claims, and may not otherwise<br />
            preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. This waiver of class actions<br />
            and collective relief is an essential part of this arbitration provision and cannot be severed<br />
            from it.<br />
            c. Arbitration Procedures.<br />
            Any disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms, including any questions<br />
            regarding its existence, validity, or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by<br />
            BINDING ARBITRATION under the London Court of International Arbitration (&ldquo;LCIA&rdquo;) Rules<br />
            in force when the Notice of Arbitration is submitted, which Rules are deemed to be<br />
            incorporated by reference into this clause.<br />
            - Overview. Arbitration is an alternative to litigation where a neutral person (the arbitrator)<br />
            hears and decides the parties&rsquo; dispute. Arbitration proceedings are designed to provide<br />
            parties with a fair hearing in a manner that is faster and less formal than court proceedings.<br />
            The following procedures (the &ldquo;Arbitration Procedures&rdquo;) are applicable to all arbitration<br />
            proceedings involving you and us.<br />
            - Administrator. The administrator for the arbitration is the LCIA, a non-profit organization<br />
            that is not affiliated with us. The arbitrator who will hear and decide your dispute will be<br />
            appointed by the LCIA in accordance with its rules. Information about the LCIA&rsquo;s rules and<br />
            fees can be found at: https://www.lcia.org//Dispute_Resolution_Services/lcia-arbitration-<br />
            rules-2014.aspx.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>- Choice of Law. The governing law applicable to the arbitration agreement and the<br />
            arbitration shall be the laws of England and Wales (also known as English Law), without<br />
            regard to English Law&rsquo;s conflict of laws rules.<br />
            - Language. The language of the arbitration shall be English.<br />
            - Applicable Rules. The arbitration will be governed by the LCIA&rsquo;s Arbitration Rules (&ldquo;LCIA<br />
            Rules&rdquo;), as modified by these Arbitration Procedures. If there is any inconsistency between<br />
            the LCIA&rsquo;s Rules and these Arbitration Procedures, the Arbitration Procedures will control.<br />
            However, if the arbitrator determines that strict application of the Arbitration Procedures<br />
            would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration, the arbitrator may make any order<br />
            necessary to provide a fundamentally fair arbitration that is consistent with the LCIA Rules.<br />
            - Commencing an Arbitration. To commence an arbitration against us, you must complete a<br />
            written request for arbitration, submit it to the LCIA, and send a copy to us at email address<br />
            indicate in Section 15. To learn more about commencing an arbitration and to obtain a form<br />
            to institute arbitration, see the LCIA&rsquo;s online filing page, https://onlinefiling.lcia.org/. You may<br />
            represent yourself in the arbitration or have a lawyer (or some other representative) act on<br />
            your behalf. Upon receipt of an arbitration claim, we may assert any counterclaims it may<br />
            have against the complaining party.<br />
            - Fees. You are responsible for paying your portion of the fees set forth in the LCIA&rsquo;s<br />
            Schedule of LCIA Arbitration Costs and as determined by the Arbitral Tribunal under LCIA<br />
            Rules. We will pay all remaining fees. If your claim against us is for less than USD1,000, we<br />
            will pay all fees. You may hire an attorney to represent you in arbitration. You are<br />
            responsible for your attorneys&rsquo; fees and additional costs. Notwithstanding anything in this<br />
            Arbitration Provision to the contrary, we will pay all fees and costs that we are required by<br />
            law to pay.<br />
            - Selection of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator who will hear and decide your dispute will be<br />
            appointed by the LCIA in accordance with its rules.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>- Discovery. Each party may (a) request relevant, non-privileged documents from the other<br />
            party; and (b) request that the other party provide the particulars of its claims or defenses.<br />
            Any such discovery requests must be served on the other party within 10 days after the<br />
            arbitrator&rsquo;s appointment. The responding party shall provide the requesting party with all<br />
            responsive, non-privileged documents, the requested particulars, and/or any objections to<br />
            the requests within 15 days after receipt of the requests. Any disputes about discovery or<br />
            requests for extensions shall be submitted promptly to the arbitrator for prompt resolution. In<br />
            ruling on any discovery dispute or extension request, the arbitrator shall take into<br />
            consideration the nature, amount, and scope of the underlying arbitration claim, the cost and<br />
            other effort what would be involved in providing the requested discovery, the case schedule,<br />
            and whether the requested discovery is necessary for the adequate preparation of a claim<br />
            or defense.<br />
            - Communications with the Arbitrator. Whenever communicating with the arbitrator, the<br />
            parties must include each other &ndash; for example, by including the other party on a telephone<br />
            conference call and copying the other party on any written submissions, such as letters or<br />
            emails. To the extent practicable, conferences with the arbitrator will take place by<br />
            telephone conference call or email. Ex parte communications are not permitted with any<br />
            arbitrator.<br />
            - Confidentiality. Upon either party&rsquo;s request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that<br />
            confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in<br />
            documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration<br />
            or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted filing of confidential<br />
            information must be done under seal.<br />
            - Arbitration Award. The arbitrator will render a written decision within 14 days after the<br />
            hearing or, if no hearing was held, within 30 days after any rebuttal or supplemental<br />
            statements are due. The decision must clearly specify the relief, if any, awarded and contain<br />
            a brief statement of the reasons for the award.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>- Waiver of Appeal. The parties waive any right to refer any question of law and any right of<br />
            appeal on the law and/or the merits to any court.<br />
            - Survivability. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Terms.<br />
            12. GOVERNING LAW<br />
            12.1. These Terms shall be governed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales<br />
            (excluding its body of law governing conflicts of law).<br />
            12.2. To the extent that any action relating to any dispute hereunder is for whatever reason<br />
            not submitted to arbitration, each of the parties submits to the exclusive jurisdiction to the<br />
            courts of England and Wales to settle any disputes which may arise out of or in connection<br />
            with this Terms and that accordingly proceedings must be brought in such courts.<br />
            12.3. The parties irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the courts of<br />
            England and waive any defenses of improper venue or forum non conveniens.<br />
            13. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS<br />
            13.1. No delay or omission by us in exercising any of our rights occurring upon any<br />
            noncompliance or default by you with respect to these Terms will impair any such right or be<br />
            construed to be a waiver thereof, and a waiver by the Company of any of the covenants,<br />
            conditions or agreements to be performed by you will not be construed to be a waiver of any<br />
            succeeding breach thereof or of any other covenant, condition or agreement hereof<br />
            contained.<br />
            13.2. Subject to Section 12, if any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or<br />
            unenforceable, then these Terms will remain in full force and effect and will be reformed to</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>be valid and enforceable while reflecting the intent of the parties to the greatest extent<br />
            permitted by law.<br />
            13.3. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, these Terms set forth the entire<br />
            agreement between you and the Company regarding its subject matter, and supersede all<br />
            prior promises, agreements or representations, whether written or oral, regarding such<br />
            subject matter.<br />
            13.4. The Company may transfer or assign any and all of its rights and obligations under<br />
            these Terms to any other person, by any way, including by novation, and by accepting these<br />
            Terms you give the Company consent to any such assignment and transfer. You confirm<br />
            that placing on the Service of a version of these Terms indicating another person as a party<br />
            to the Terms shall constitute valid notice to you of the transfer of Company&#39;s rights and<br />
            obligations under the Terms (unless otherwise is expressly indicated).<br />
            13.5. All information communicated on the Service is considered an electronic<br />
            communication. When you communicate with us through or on the Service or via other<br />
            forms of electronic media, such as e-mail, you are communicating with us electronically.<br />
            You agree that we may communicate electronically with you and that such communications,<br />
            as well as notices, disclosures, agreements, and other communications that we provide to<br />
            you electronically, are equivalent to communications in writing and shall have the same<br />
            force and effect as if they were in writing and signed by the party sending the<br />
            communication. You further acknowledge and agree that by clicking on a button labeled<br />
            &quot;SUBMIT&quot;, &quot;CONTINUE&quot;, &quot;REGISTER&quot;, &quot;I AGREE&quot; or similar links or buttons, you are<br />

            SIGNATURES, CONTRACTS, ORDERS AND OTHER RECORDS AND TO ELECTRONIC<br />
            DELIVERY OF NOTICES, POLICIES AND RECORDS OF TRANSACTIONS INITIATED<br />

        <p>13.6. In no event shall the Company be liable for any failure to comply with these Terms to<br />
            the extent that such failure arises from factors outside the Company&#39;s reasonable control.<br />
